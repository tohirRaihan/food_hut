                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Always passionate about food and dining from a young age, I got my first job in the food industry at 14 busing tables at a diner on weekends and have been working with food ever since. My experience spans both front and back of house, including restaurants, bakeries, wineries, and catering. Travel has always inspired my cooking and my menus draw inspiration from the wide range of places I have visited, from Italy to India and many places in between. </p>
